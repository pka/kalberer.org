### Current status and next steps

Some BBOX services are in production use since a long time and other features like authentication and CORS header support are in a proof-of-concept stage. With releasing BBOX 0.5.0, we give early adopters the possiblity to provide feedback and influence further developement.

The next short term steps are adding more documentation, especially guides for various usage scenarios.
